# Week1-assignment
Requirements Achieved:

As a be I successfully completed the core requirements for this project:

Structured the webpage with semantic HTML tags for sections like header, hero, about, and footer.
Styled the webpage using CSS, including responsive design elements and hover effects.
Integrated images, links, and text content to create an engaging and functional design.
Ensured the webpage displays correctly in a browser with proper navigation and layout.

Requirements Not Achieved:

While I achieved the essential requirements, there are some advanced features and goals I couldn’t fully implement:
The News section mentioned in the README was not included due to time constraints and limited experience.
I wasn’t able to add JavaScript-based interactivity, such as smooth scrolling or animations, as I’m still learning JavaScript.

Challenges Faced:

Installation Issues Faced During the Project

Reflection on the Issue:
While it was frustrating initially, this challenge taught me the importance of having a clear file structure and paying attention to detail with paths. By the end of the project, I became more confident in managing assets and troubleshooting errors. 
This experience will help me avoid similar problems in future projects.

At the beginning of the project, I encountered an issue with setting up. Specifically, I struggled with organizing files and ensuring that all paths in the project (e.g., image paths, CSS file links) were correct. This issue led to broken links, missing styles, and images not displaying correctly in the browser.
I learned how to write correct relative paths in the HTML file.
I opened the index.html file in the browser after every change to ensure paths and links were working.
Image Path Errors: Initially, my images didn’t load because of incorrect relative paths. I fixed this by carefully reviewing and matching the file structure.
Responsive Design: Ensuring the design looks good on smaller devices was a bit challenging. I learned how to use CSS media queries but didn’t fully optimize all sections.
Time Management: Balancing between learning and completing the tasks within the deadline was a challenge.

This assignment was a great learning experience, helping me understand the fundamentals of web development. I’m proud of the progress I made, and I now have a better foundation to tackle more advanced projects in the future.
